# Teachers manual

Focused on teachers, this section will be, on the one hand, a tutorial on the use of the tool and, on the other, a pedagogical guide for its implementation. 

Therefore, it will be led by [Karlstad](http://www.kau.se/), given his competence in pedagogy and particularly in e-learning. It will also have the collaboration of [CIFP Carlos III](https://cifpcarlos3.es/) and [Bursa MEM](http://bursa.meb.gov.tr/), which are the representative partners of Vocational Training and will allow the manual to be adapted to the curricula of these teachings.

Block one will consist of the following sections:

- JuezLTI Features
- Access to JuezLTI from my LMS (Moodle, Sakai, Canvas)
- Pre-defined exercises and training itineraries
- Import and export of exercises
- Student monitoring
- Definition of new problems and itineraries
- Didactic methodologies with JuezLTI
