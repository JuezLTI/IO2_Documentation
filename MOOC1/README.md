# Teachers manual

Focused on teachers, this section will be, on the one hand, a tutorial on the use of the tool and, on the other, a pedagogical guide for its implementation. 

Therefore, it will be led by [Karlstad](http://www.kau.se/), given his competence in pedagogy and particularly in e-learning. It will also have the collaboration of [CIFP Carlos III](https://cifpcarlos3.es/) and [Bursa MEM](http://bursa.meb.gov.tr/), which are the representative partners of Vocational Training and will allow the manual to be adapted to the curricula of these teachings.

Block one will consist of the following sections:

- [Introduction to JuezLTI](en/introJuezLTI.md)
- [Getting credentials for JuezLTI](en/gettingCredentials.md)
- [Using JuezLTI in LMS](en/usingInMoodle.md)
- [Teacher View](en/teacherView.md)
  - [Creating an exercise](en/teacherView.md#creating-an-exercise)
    - [Programming exercises](en/teacherView.md#java-exercise-example)
    - [SQL exercises](en/teacherView.md#postgresql-exercise-examples)
    - XML exercises
  - [Importing exercises from Authorkit](en/teacherView.md#importing-exercises-from-authorkit)
- [Student View](en/studentView.md)
- [Reviewing results](en/reviewingResults.md)
- [Backup and restore](en/backupRestore.md)
