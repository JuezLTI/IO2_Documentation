# Backup and restore

Instructors could export the context (activity) with the exercises is composed to import it into a different activity or LMS.

The steps to do it would be the next:

1. Export the context to a zip file, selecting the option showed in the image below.

![Export to a zip file](../docs/img/backupRestore/exportZipFile.png)

2. Create a new activity in the LMS as explains the _[Using In Moodle](usingInMoodle.md)_ chapter.
3. Open activity and access to _Teacher View_
4. Import the zip file previously downloaded into the current context.
![Import zip file into context](../docs/img/backupRestore/importZipFile.png)
5. Confirm the import.

At the end, you will see as the number of exercises has changed and is increased until the number of the exercises belongs to the original context.
