# IO2: Documentation and MOOC of JuezLTI
An open online course is being developed and taught to train teachers on all aspects related to JuezLTI:
- Foundations of JuezLTI.
- Implementation on the institution's servers.
- Use of the centralized question repository.
- Connection with the L.M.S. of the institution.
- Development of questionnaires and questions.
- Exportation and importation.
- Examples of training itineraries

This second intellectual product therefore proposes the development of the documentation associated with the JuezLTI application: [teacher's manual](MOOC1/README.md#teachers-manual), [deployment manual](MOOC2/README.md#deployment-manual) and [development manual](MOOC2/README.md#development-manual). Based on these materials, an online course will be built in a massive and open format (MOOC).

As leaders, the [Karlstad Uni](http://www.kau.se/) will be in charge of the pedagogical design of the MOOC, as well as the style and format guides that the materials to be developed must follow. Likewise, they will control the unanimous development of the tasks assigned to each partner.

The MOOC will have three differentiated blocks, each of which will be developed by one of the partners, based on their knowledge and participation in the project.
The language in which the materials will be developed will be English, so all partners will collaborate in the translation tasks into their native language: Swedish, Turkish, Portuguese and [Spanish](README_es.md).

## Choice of language
- [English](README.md)
- [Spanish](README_es.md)
- [Portuguese](README_pt.md)
