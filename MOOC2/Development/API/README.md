# Internal API

JuezLTI is structured in different modules, as explained in the Architecture. Four kinds of module participate in structure, namely: 

 - **Student View** - where students attempt to solve exercises;
 - **Evaluator** of student attempts sent by the previous module;
 - **Feedback Manager** - processes reports generated by evaluators to produce meaningful messages; 
 - **Central Repository** - containing exercises and other configurations

 It should be noted that while most of these participants are singletons, the **Evaluator** is a kind of module with several instances. There is a programming language evaluator, a markup languages evaluator and database evaluator.

The communication among these modules is illustrated by the following diagram. Using the **Student View**,  a student submits an attempt to an **Evaluator**. This component assesses this attempt attempt using an exercise retrieved from the **Central Repository** and produces a **report**. This report is submitted to the **Feedback manager** to produces a **feedback** that is returned to the **StudentView** and presented to the student  This communication among these modules is regulated by an internal API.
