# Internal API

JuezLTI is structured in different modules, as explained in the [Architecture](../Architecture/README.md). Four kinds of modules participate in its structure, namely: 

 - **Student View** - where students attempt to solve exercises;
 - **Evaluator** of student attempts sent by the previous module;
 - **Feedback Manager** - processes reports generated by evaluators to produce meaningful  messages; 
 - **Central Repository** - containing exercises and other configurations

 It should be noted that while most of these participants are singletons, the **Evaluator** is a kind of module with several instances. There is a programming language evaluator, a markup languages evaluator, and database evaluator. In addition to the validators developed during the project, efforts have been made to extend the platform so that any institution can implement its own validators.

The following diagram illustrates the communication among these modules. Using the **Student View**,  a student submits an attempt to an **Evaluator**. This component assesses this attempt using an exercise retrieved from the **Central Repository** and produces a **report**. The evaluator submits the report to the **Feedback manager** to produce a **feedback** that is returned to the **StudentView** and presented to the student.

The communication among modules is regulated by an internal [API formalized in Swagger](https://github.com/JuezLTI/APIs/blob/d981488ba77f238f2aaeb6f862ab1c2a0e8252d9/v2/API.yaml#L16). Most data communicated is unstructured, 
with the exception of exercises and reports that use, respectivelly:

- [`YAPExIL`](YAPExIL/README.md) -  a programming exercise format;
- [`PEARL`](PEARL/README.md) a common format for evaluation reports.
